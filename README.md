# GraphQL Exercise

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of the GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of the React application.

To get started running the app

In a Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

Feel free to use 'yarn install' and 'yarn start' if you prefer

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Some quick notes

- The React app 
1. Uses Material UI for quick "out of the box" components
2. Was bootstrapped using create-react-app
3. Has a mix of inline and stylized styling (this was more for speed than anything else)

- The Apollo GraphQL server 
1. Heavily influenced by the Odyssey tutorials
